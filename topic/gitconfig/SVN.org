http://stackoverflow.com/questions/182945/how-to-see-what-will-be-updated-from-repository-before-issuing-svn-update-comm

Depending on what you want to know between your working copy and the latest svn server repository, without updating your local working copy, here is what you can do:

if you want to know what has been changed in svn server repository, run
 command: $ svn st -u


if you want to know if the same file has been modified both in your local working copy and in svn server repository, run command:
$ svn st -u |grep -i "^M \{7\}\*"


if you want to get list of files changed between a particular revision and HEAD, run command:
$ svn diff -r revisionNumber:HEAD --summarize


if you want to get a list of files changed between paticular revisions, run command:
$ svn diff -r revisionNumber:anotherRevisionNumber --summarize


if you want to see what will be updated (without actually updating), run command:
$ svn merge --dry-run -r BASE:HEAD .


if you want to know what content of a particular file has been changed in svn server repository compared with your working copy, run command:
$ svn diff -r BASE:HEAD ./pathToYour/file


if you want to know what contents of all the files have been changed in svn server repository compared with your working copy, run command:
$ svn diff -r BASE:HEAD .

* Overview

The following aliases are interesting for using SVN a bit like Git.

* Log

** One-line log format

#+begin_src shell
alias svnlog="svn log | perl -l40pe 's/^-+/\n/'"
#+end_src

** Show a single revision

#+begin_src shell
svn diff -c <revision>
#+end_src

** Show what changed

Output filenames of files changed in each commit:

#+begin_src shell
svn log -v
#+end_src

* Incoming changes

** Check for modifications

Show which files are modified in the repository (with an ~*~):

#+begin_src shell
alias svn-incoming='svn status -u | grep \*'
#+end_src

#+begin_src shell
svn log -r BASE:HEAD                    # Equivalent of `git log'
svn log --diff -r BASE:HEAD             # Equivalent of `git log -p'
#+end_src

** Preview incoming changes

See what has been changed (how it's different from my working copy):

#+begin_src shell
svn diff -r BASE:HEAD
#+end_src
